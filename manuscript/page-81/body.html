On one such occasion he magnificently left the room and slammed the door after him, but I think that he probably regretted that act of violence before he reached home.

I wonder if his wife began by being sorry for him, and if her escapade was incidentally intended as a shaking? Did she flaunt her wickedness at him in the hope of “rousing him up”? If so, she failed, ignominiously.</p></div> </div>
